# Introduction to Apollo
**The GraphQL toolkit**

## What is Apollo?
Apollo is a _team_ and _community_ that build on top of GraphQL, and provides tools that help you build your projects.

Tools provided by Apollo are mainly 3:
* **Client**
> It helps you **consume a GraphQL API**, with popular frameworks.  
* **Server**
> Itâ€™s the **server part of GraphQL**, which _interfaces with backend and sends responses back to the client requests_.  
* **Engine**
> A hosted infrastructure (SAAS) that serves **as a middle man between the client and server**, _providing caching, performance reporting, load measurement, error tracking and many goodies_.  

**You can use just Apollo Client to interface with a 3rd party API, or serve an API using Apollo Server without having a client at all.**
Apollo is backed by the  [Meteor Development Group](https://www.meteor.io/) , the company behind  [Meteor](https://flaviocopes.com/meteor/)
